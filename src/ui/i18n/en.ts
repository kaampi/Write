    heading: "A fully closed digital safe",
    body: "kaampi Write is built around one rule: your manuscript is your property, and it should never leave your computer. There is no way out to the internet in the app itself — no API keys for ChatGPT, Claude, or other cloud services (that's not a missing feature, it's a deliberate choice), and the fonts ship bundled with the app instead of being fetched from anywhere. Your text lives only in your browser, and the AI model runs only on your own processor. The separate desktop app (optional) can check whether a newer version of itself exists — never of your manuscript, which it doesn't even have access to. Whatever you're writing — a diary, trade secrets, or your next big fantasy epic — every letter stays with you."

  author: {
    heading: "Author beats AI, always",

  chapters: {
    heading: "Chapters: Draft, Recast, Analyze",
    body: "Draft writes new prose from what is established. Recast rewrites the same chapter in a different point of view or tense, keeping the same events. Analyze reviews a chapter for common craft issues without rewriting a word — telling instead of showing (instead of \"Lisa was furious,\" it might suggest \"Lisa slammed the door so hard the coffee cups rattled\"), filler dialogue, or a beat that clashes with a locked trait. Reader (in Settings, and per chapter) sets who it is written for — Board book through Adult — so sentence length and word choice match that age. Below the text, Rare and Clichés toggle two optional highlights — uncommon words for that reader, and phrasing that reads as AI-generated (\"a testament to\", overused em dashes) — one at a time, off by default."
  },

Right-click with nothing selected instead, and you get a single option, Write a beat…: describe what happens next in one line, and the model writes just that — a short paragraph, not the rest of the scene — dropped in exactly at your cursor. Selecting a passage also shows a small Bold/Italic/Underline toolbar above it (or Ctrl+B/I/U) — display formatting only, saved separately from the text itself, so it never reaches the model."

    heading: "A picture for the chapter",

  "illustration-prompts": {
    heading: "Illustration prompts",
    body: "Select a passage and choose Illustration prompt… from the right-click menu. The model writes an image-generation prompt — not a picture — built from the passage, your locked Story Bible facts, and your manuscript's illustration style, ready to paste into whatever image generator you use; kaampi Write stays fully local and never generates the image itself. Set a default style under Settings → Illustration style, or open the style library to save named, reusable styles — each with its own genre tags and an example image — so every prompt keeps a consistent look across the book."

Draft never leans on a note you haven't lifted into Synopsis. (Ask the model about your notes, or have it extend or elaborate one, and it naturally reads what you're asking about — but nothing from there becomes canon or leaks into chapter-writing on its own.) Lift the ideas that stick into Synopsis: the shape of the whole book, in a few sentences. It's what the AI model leans on when it later helps you write chapters."

    body: "The single source of truth for your story's facts — who someone is, where a place is, what a name means. A fact starts as a proposal, from you or from an extraction pass, and only becomes locked truth once you approve it. Locked facts are what the model is told it must not contradict — if a new proposal contradicts an already-locked fact (say, someone suddenly has brown eyes when you've locked blue), it gets flagged extra clearly in the review queue. Open a card and press Interview to chat about it — in a character's own voice, or, for a place, object, group, or concept, with a worldbuilding collaborator who discusses it in the third person — built only from what is locked so far. A way to hear a voice or explore lore and spot gaps, not to create new canon. If something said is worth keeping, press Extract facts to propose it for the Story Bible, same review queue as any other extraction — nothing is added until you approve it. Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on Mac) a known name anywhere in your prose to jump straight to its card — a plain click still just places your cursor there, as usual."
  },
  continuity: {
    heading: "Continuity warnings",
    body: "When a chapter can see a fact that was only established later in the manuscript, it is flagged — not necessarily wrong, maybe it is a flashback, just worth a glance.

  proofread: {
    heading: "Proofread",
    body: "A last pass over the whole manuscript: grammar, repeated scenes, style and mood drift between chapters, age-appropriateness, a continuity check, a look for planted details that never pay off (a gun shown in chapter 4 that no one ever fires), and a fact check against the whole book. When Reader is set to a children's or YA level, it also flags swearing, violence, or explicit content that does not fit that age. Notes only — nothing is rewritten for you.

A character named Rose means every mention of a rose garden, a rose bush, or roses on a table looks like a sighting of her. Exclusion phrases fix that — add \"rose garden\" as an exclusion on Rose's card, and that specific phrase stops counting as a mention of her, while \"Rose smiled\" still does."

Every fact moves onto the merged card; where the two cards disagreed, you choose which value wins; each old name becomes an alias of the merged card, so a later mention of either still resolves correctly. There's also an option to replace the old names with the new one in the manuscript text itself.\n\nThe same merging also works the other way — a pending suggestion from Extract facts can be merged straight onto an existing card from the review queue, instead of locking it as a new card first and merging afterward."

The earlier value stays visible in History instead of being overwritten, since both were true — just at different points in the story.\n\nIdentity facts (name, species, that kind of thing) only ever get Edit — there's rarely a story reason for someone's name to change mid-book the way their hair color or where they live might."

After the interview, kaampi Write can help you identify possible facts:\n\"Nora's mother withheld information about the father's disappearance.\"\n\nNow you choose.\nLock the fact — then it becomes an established part of Story Bible.\nDon't lock it — then it stays something explored during the interview, and shouldn't be treated as established information when the book is written.\n\nWhen a fact only becomes true later in the chapter\nOne important detail: a fact locked to a chapter applies from the chapter's first page. Draft can use the fact right there — even if it's actually only true later in the chapter.\n\nExample: your protagonist meets an old friend, Marcus, in chapter 6. The chapter opens as an ordinary reunion. Only partway through does the protagonist realize Marcus is the one who's secretly been working against him — Marcus is the antagonist. If you extract \"Marcus is the antagonist\" from the Interview and lock it to chapter 6, Draft has access to the reveal already when it writes the opening reunion, as if nobody yet knows what Marcus is really up to.\n\nLock the fact to a specific scene instead\nIf the fact should only become available once the reveal happens, you can link it to the scene where it happens.\n\nFirst split chapter 6 into scenes (Scenes → Split into two…) at the point where the reveal happens, so the reunion and the reveal become separate scenes. When you then extract the fact from the Interview, the \"As of\" picker shows that chapter's scenes — pick the reveal's scene instead of \"Whole chapter\". Draft now only gets access to the fact from that scene onward.\n\nIf you draft scene by scene (Scenes → Draft), you can write the reunion without Draft having access to the fact yet. Once you reach the reveal's scene, Draft gets access to it, and it then applies for the rest of the chapter.\n\nImportant: this only works with scene-by-scene Draft\nThe scene link only affects Draft when you write one scene at a time. Run Draft for the whole chapter, and Draft has access to every fact attributed to the chapter, whichever scene it's linked to.\n\nIf you prefer drafting whole chapters in one pass, the simpler workaround still applies: hold off locking the fact until you've written past the turn, or draft the chapter in two passes and lock the fact only before the second."
