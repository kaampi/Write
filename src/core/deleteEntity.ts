/**
 * Fully erases a Story Bible entity — every fact under this entity_ref
 * (locked, pending, and superseded alike), its character profile, its
 * pictures, its hidden-from-draft flag, any manual kind override, and its
 * tracked aliases/exclusions (found missing from this cleanup, alongside
 * mergeEntities.ts, which needed the same list and goes through it fully).
 * Unlike revising a fact (which supersedes, keeping history intact for
 * something that still exists), this is a real delete: for an entity that
 * should never have been there at all — a duplicate, a test card, a
 * scrapped character — "Hide from draft" already covers the case of
 * keeping a card around but out of the model's sight.
 *
 * Also scrubs this entity_ref out of every OTHER event's profile: a
 * deleted Character drops out of any event's `participants`, a deleted
 * Location clears any event's `where` that pointed to it. Otherwise a
 * Location's derived "who was here" view would keep resolving a stale
 * ref to nothing (or, worse, to whatever new entity later reuses that
 * ref's slug).
