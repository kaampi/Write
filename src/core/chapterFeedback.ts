Return JSON only, shaped as: {"items":[{"category":"show_vs_tell","quote":"...","observation":"..."}]}

Categories (the first four always; the last two only when Reader is under 18):
- show_vs_tell: flag a sentence that NAMES an inner state with a telling verb (felt, was afraid, seemed determined). "Emma felt sad" is a flag. Sensory image, metaphor, and action that already embody a state are a pass — omit them. "The Odyssey hums to life around them, a symphony of machinery" is showing. Do not flag it.
- dialogue_purpose: filler speech that does neither — it does not reveal character AND it does not move the scene. A tease, a challenge, banter with subtext, an order, or a relationship beat is doing work: omit it. Quote only the spoken words, not the shrug or the eyes. If your observation would say the line reveals something, delete the item. "Tide's late" as empty weather talk can be a flag. "Someone's gotta keep you on your toes, Captain" is not.
- voice_drift: the register slipped from the Voice field partway through. Quote the drift. Skip this category entirely if Voice is unset.
- character_fidelity: a beat sits in tension with a locked Story Bible trait or personality. Quote the beat. Name the trait in relatedFact. This is not a fact contradiction and not a proposed bible change.
- child_agency: skip unless Reader is under 18. Flag when a parent, teacher, or other authority makes the decisive move. Adults may hand a tool or context; the child must take the last step. Quote the adult's decisive beat.
- lecture: skip unless Reader is under 18. Flag when a moral is stated by an adult (or the narrator) rather than earned by the protagonist's choice. Quote the lecture. Do not flag a consequence the child lives.

Rules:
- quote must be verbatim from the chapter prose, short enough to find.
- observation names the problem in one short sentence. It is not a rewrite and not a paraphrase of the quote.
- Never invent facts. Never use material that is not in the chapter, the Voice field, the Reader field, or the Story Bible.
- Never mention brainstorm, secrets, or notes you were not given.
- If a category has nothing solid, omit it. Empty is allowed: {"items":[]}.
- At most 10 items. Prefer the strongest flags, not one of each.
- If you catch yourself writing that the quote already shows something, delete that item.`;
