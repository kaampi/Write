; -- kaampi Write — online installer stub --
;
; A small bootstrapper (roadmap-ideas.md #35), inspired by the "online
; installer" pattern on OnlyOffice's download page: instead of bundling
; everything into one large download, this tiny .exe downloads the two
; real payloads at install time —
;   1. Ollama's own official Windows installer, run silently — but only
;      if the user opts in on the page below AND neither Ollama nor
;      LM Studio is already detected; and
;   2. the current kaampi Write installer (always the latest GitHub
;      Release — this file never needs to be rebuilt just because the
;      app shipped a new version), handed off to the user normally so
;      they see the same installer screens already tested in v1.0.30+.
;
; kaampi Write's own Settings already support LM Studio (or any other
; OpenAI-compatible local server) via the "OpenAI-compatible" engine
; option — this stub's job is only to not get in that person's way by
; presuming they want Ollama too.
;
; This stub installs nothing itself (Uninstallable=no below) — it only
; orchestrates the two downloads above, then exits.
;
; Uses Inno Setup 6.3+'s built-in [Files] "download" flag (see the
; official jrsoftware/issrc Examples/DownloadFiles.iss), not a
; third-party plugin DLL — nothing extra to bundle or keep updated.

WelcomeLabel2=This will set up kaampi Write on your computer.%n%nThe next page lets you choose whether to also install Ollama, the local AI engine kaampi Write uses — skip it if you already use Ollama, prefer LM Studio, or have your own local server.%n%nkaampi Write itself never sends your manuscript anywhere; see the in-app Guide for details.
